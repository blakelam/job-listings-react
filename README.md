# Job Listings Page

[Live Preview](https://blam-joblistings.netlify.app/)

A Challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) built in React. I built the page with HTML + CSS, ported to React, and will be working on the filter functionality.

I'm learning and open to any and all feedback that can help me improve.
